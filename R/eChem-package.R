#' Simulations for Electrochemistry Experiments
#'
#' A collection of functions for simulating four different types of
#' electrochemistry experiments: two potential step experiments
#' (chronoamperometry and chronocoulometry) and two potential scan experiments
#' (linear-sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry). Each simuluation allows
#' for either an oxidation reaction or for a reduction reaction, and allows for
#' a single following or a single preceeding chemical reaction. Also included
#' are a variety of functions for displaying the result of a simulation in
#' either a static or animated format.
